Dr. Karen Barnard-Kubow and co-authors publish a comprehensive study examining genetic determinants and environmental distribution of genetic variation in male production in the cyclic parthenogen, Daphnia pulex. Using extensive genomic characterization and a new high quality genome, this work demonstrates the importance of habitat ephemerality on the genetic composition of populations and maps genetic variation in reproductive mode using lab crosses, field sampling, and RNA-seq. This work took place in the beautiful Dorset coast in Southern England and highlights how seasonal fluctuations in habitat suitability can maintain genetic variation in fitness traits.
