We are excited to welcome Megan Stephenson to the Bergland Lab as a lab technician and manager. Megan will be heading up our Backyard Evolution Citizen science program, and coordinating our seasonal sampling efforts. They completed their bachelorâ€™s degree in biology at George Mason University, where they worked in the Hanley Lab studying the coevolution of egg colors and brood parasites. In their free time, they enjoy reading memoirs, looking for bugs, and making miniatures with their family.

Welcome Megan!
