The Bergland lab is looking to recruit a post-doc and a technician to study seasonal evolution in flies. We have ongoing projects examining the genetic basis of seasonal evolution, metapopulation dynamics, and the role of habitat type on seasonal dynamics of evolutionary change.

For the prospective post-doc, possible projects range from bioinformatic to field based to experimental. The post-doc position can also integrate into our ongoing citizen science fly collection project (Backyard Evolution) as well as the international DrosEU consortium that we participate in. There is guaranteed NSF funding for at least two years.

The technician position is to organize field drosophila sampling efforts in the Virginia area, to coordinate a Citizen Science project collecting flies, and to help run our Drosophila culture facility.
