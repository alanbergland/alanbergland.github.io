Congratulations to Dr. Yang Yu for a successfull defense of his PhD. <br>

Dr. Yu conducted research studying the mechanissm of seasonal adaptation in Drosophila focusing on expression dynamics and plasticity. His first chapter focused on spatial and temporal dynamics of allele frequency change at eQTL (see publication in Evolution). His second chapter was an ambitious experiment to study seasonal gene expression in the field. And, his third chapter focused on seasonal plasticity in fitness related phenotypes.
