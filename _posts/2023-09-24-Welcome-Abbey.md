They join us fresh off of an NSF PRFB at the University of Connecticut working with Dr. Elizabeth Jockusch on the evolution of wings focusing on the non-model system <i>Leptoglossus zonatus</i>. Their PhD work focused on wing polyphenic development in crickets with Dr. Laura Lavine. Abbey is also passionate about teaching, outreach and DEI - to learn more visit their website: https://abigailhayesphd.wixsite.com/main
