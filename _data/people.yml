        Dr. Abigail "Abbey" Hayes is a postdoctoral research associate working on seasonal evolution and the traits associated with a seasonally varying chromosomal inversion in Drosophila. Abbey's general research interests lie at the intersection of phenotype, genotype, and environment. They join us fresh off of an NSF PRFB at the University of Connecticut working with Dr. Elizabeth Jockusch on the evolution of wings focusing on the non-model system Leptoglossus zonatus. Their PhD work focused on wing polyphenic development in crickets with Dr. Laura Lavine. Abbey is also passionate about teaching, outreach and DEI - to learn more visit their [website](https://abigailhayesphd.wixsite.com/main)

        I am interested in the production and hatching of daphnia resting eggs, and investigating the environmental cues involved in the differing responses between clonal lineages. As part of this, I am also interested in how populations of daphnia maintain genetic diversity over longer timescales. Previously, I worked on image collection and analysis of _Daphnia pulex_ neonates exposed to predator kairomones, to measure the plastic response of necktooth induction.

      profile: I am interested in understanding how inversions, particularly In(2L)t in Drosophila melanogaster, contribute to phenotypic variation and rapid adaptation. By developing genetic tools and using global Drosophila collections, my current project aims to identify the specific genes in In(2L)t responsible for phenotypic variation and test two competing hypothesis regarding the role of inversion in adaptation.

        My research studies patterns of genetic variation in natural populations living  in highly variable environments. I seek to characterize what loci are under selection at different scales of environmental heterogeneity both in space and time. My research program seeks to determine the identity of these ecologically important loci, as well as the mechanisms that underlie their maintenance of genetic variation. I did my PhD at Brown with David M. Rand woking on intertidal barnacles. I did my undergraduate at the University of Miami with  Margie F. Oleksiak and Doug L. Crawford working on killifish.

      image: /assets/images/profiles/dorthebecker.JPEG
      profile: |
        Dr. Dörthe Becker is a physiological ecologist interested in the molecular mechanisms by which various stressors are tolerated via acclimation. During her PhD, her research focused on highly conserved stress-induced signaling processes that enable Daphnia to adequately adjust their physiological performance upon environmental change. For her subsequent post-doctoral research with [Andrew Beckerman](https://www.beckslab.staff.shef.ac.uk/) and [John Colbourne](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/biosciences/colbourne-john.aspx) she broadened her research towards the field of environmental genomics in order to explore the regulatory mechanisms that provide the basis for tolerance, acclimation and phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, her research on different Daphnia genotypes investigated the molecular signatures of predator induced changes in life history and morphology, with particular focus on how these responses are modified by other environmental contaminants (e.g. metals). Her research in the Bergland lab continued this line of research as part of the on-going project on dynamics of predation induced adaptation in Daphnia.
