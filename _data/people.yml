        Dr. Alan O. Bergland is an Associate Professor in the Biology Deptartment at the University of Virginia.
        He is interested in basic questions in evolutionary and ecological genetics and studies flies, water-fleas,
        and birds. Check out the [research page](/what-we-do/) for more details.
        For papers from the Bergland lab, check out the [publications page](/publications/).

        Dr. Abigail "Abbey" Hayes is a postdoctoral research associate working on seasonal evolution and the traits associated with a seasonally varying chromosomal inversion in Drosophila. Abbey's general research interests lie at the intersection of phenotype, genotype, and environment. They join us fresh off of an NSF PRFB at the University of Connecticut working with Dr. Elizabeth Jockusch on the evolution of wings focusing on the non-model system Leptoglossus zonatus. Their PhD work focused on wing polyphenic development in crickets with Dr. Laura Lavine. Abbey is also passionate about teaching, outreach and DEI - to learn more visit their [website](https://abigailhayesphd.wixsite.com/main)

        I am interested in the production and hatching of daphnia resting eggs, and investigating the environmental cues involved in the differing responses between clonal lineages. As part of this, I am also interested in how populations of daphnia maintain genetic diversity over longer timescales. Previously, I worked on image collection and analysis of _Daphnia pulex_ neonates exposed to predator kairomones, to measure the plastic response of necktooth induction.

      profile: I am interested in understanding how inversions, particularly In(2L)t in Drosophila melanogaster, contribute to phenotypic variation and rapid adaptation. By developing genetic tools and using global Drosophila collections, my current project aims to identify the specific genes in In(2L)t responsible for phenotypic variation and test two competing hypothesis regarding the role of inversion in adaptation.
