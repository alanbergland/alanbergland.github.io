The Bergland lab is committed to providing a diverse and supportive laboratory environment. <br><br>
We aim to (1) be an inclusive environment; (2) respect individual needs, styles, and career goals; (3) challenge each other to grow and learn as scientists and as humans; (4) be accountable and excellent ourselves and others. <br><br>
